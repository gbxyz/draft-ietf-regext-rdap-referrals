.# Abstract

This document describes an RDAP extension that allows RDAP clients to request to
be referred to a related RDAP record for a resource.

{mainmatter}

# Introduction

Many Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP, described in [@!RFC7480],
[@!RFC7481], [@!RFC9082], [@!RFC9083] and others) resources contain links to
related RDAP resources.

For example, in the domain space, an RDAP record for a domain name received from
the registry operator may include a link for the RDAP record for the same
object provided by the sponsoring registrar, while in the IP address space, an
RDAP record for an address allocation may include links to enclosing or
sibling prefixes.

In both cases, RDAP service users are often equally if not more interested in
these related RDAP resources than the resource provided by the TLD registry or
RIR.

While RDAP supports redirection of RDAP requests using HTTP redirections (which
use a `3xx` HTTP status and the "`Location`" header field, see Section 15.4 of
[@!RFC9110]), it is not possible for RDAP servers to know _a priori_ whether a
client requesting an RDAP record is doing so because it wants to retrieve a
related RDAP record, or its own, so it can only respond by providing the full
RDAP response. The client must then parse that response in order to extract the
relevant URL from the "`links`" property of the object.

This results in the wasteful expenditure of time, compute resources and
bandwidth on the part of both the client and server.

This document describes an extension to RDAP that allows clients to request that
an RDAP server refer them to the URL of a related resource.

# RDAP Referral Request

To request a referral to a related resource, the client sends an HTTP `GET`
request to the RDAP server with a path of the form:

```
/referrals0_ref/<relation>/<lookup path>
```

The client replaces `<lookup path>` with the lookup path of the object being
sought and the `<relation>` with the desired relationship type. For example, a
referral query for the domain `example.com` would be:

```
/referrals0_ref/related/domain/example.com
```

The referral query for the parent network of `192.0.2.42` would have the
following full path:

```
/referrals0_ref/rdap-up/ip/192.0.2.42
```

Lookup paths for domain names, IP networks, autonomous system numbers,
nameservers, and entities are described in [@!RFC9082]. Lookups defined by RDAP
extensions may also use this extension.

Referral requests for searches, where more than one object is returned, and help
queries, as described by [@!RFC9083], are not supported. Servers MUST return an
HTTP 400 for these requests.

# RDAP Referral Response

If the object specified in the request exists, a single appropriate link exists,
and the client is authorised to perform the request, the server response
**MUST** have an HTTP status code of 301 or 302, and include an HTTP `Location`
header field, whose value contains the URL of the linked resource.

When an RDAP server holds in its datastore more than one relationship type for
an object, a scenario that is possible but not common, only one of the URLs
can be returned, as determined by server policy.

The following examples use the HTTP/1.1 message exchange syntax as seen in
[@!RFC9110].

An example of a referral request from a domain registry to a domain registrar:

```
Client Request:

GET /referrals0_ref/related/domain/example.com HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/rdap+json

Server Response:

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Location: https://registrar.example/domain/example.com
```

An example of a referral request for a parent IPv4 network:

```
Client Request:

GET /referrals0_ref/rdap-up/ip/192.0.2.42 HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/rdap+json

Server Response:

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Location: https://rir.example/ip/192.0.2.0/24
```

An example of a referral request for a parent IPv6 network:

```
Client Request:

GET /referrals0_ref/rdap-up/ip/2001%3adb8%3a%3a1 HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/rdap+json"

Server Response:

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Location: https://rir.example/ip/2001%3adb8%3a%3a/32
```

## Selecting The Appropriate Link

When the server receives a referral request, it must select which of an object's
links it should use to construct the response.

The `rel` property of the selected link **MUST** match `<relation>` path
segment of the request. The `type` and `hreflang` properties of the link, if
present, **MUST** match the `Accept` and (if specified) `Accept-Language` header
fields of the request.

## Caching by Intermediaries

To facilitate caching of RDAP resources by intermediary proxies, servers which
provide a referral based on the value of the `Accept` header field in the
request **MUST** include a `Vary` header field (See Section 12.5.5 of
[@!RFC2535]) in the response. This field **MUST** include `accept`, and **MAY**
include other header field names.

Example:

```
Vary: accept, accept-language
```

# RDAP Conformance

Servers which implement this specification **MUST** include the string
"`referrals0`" in the "`rdapConformance`" array in all RDAP responses.

# IANA Considerations

IANA is requested to register the following value in the RDAP Extensions
Registry:

**Extension identifier:** `referrals0`

**Registry operator:** any.

**Published specification:** this document.

**Contact:** the authors of this document.

**Intended usage:** this extension allows clients to request to be referred to a
related resource for an RDAP resource.
